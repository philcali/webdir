# Simple Web File Management

This very simple little app lets you start a web server
to download or upload files to a directory. The idea being
to allow machines you have ssh access to, but not file
transfer service (ie: Chromebook)

# Launch

```
> webdir [-p ##]
```

# Install

Install the command line program via [cs](https://github.com/n8han/conscript#readme).

```
> cs philcali/webdir
```
